# Convolutional-Neural-Network-Model

UC Berkeley -- CS189 Machine Learning -- Homework 6 Neural Networks 
* Task 1: Design and train a multi-layer perception (MLP) model on the FashionMNIST dataset
* Task 2: Design and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model on the CIFAR-10 dataset

## Description

In this assignment, I gained hands-on experience with training neural networks using PyTorch to simulate real-world engineering scenarios. The assignment was divided into two main tasks: 

Task 1 involved training a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model on the FashionMNIST dataset, an MNIST-like dataset. I implemented the model using components such as nn.Linear, nn.ReLU, and nn.CrossEntropyLoss, achieving a validation accuracy of at least 82%. The deliverables included the code for the MLP, a plot of the training and validation loss for each epoch, and a plot of the training and validation accuracy.

Task 2 focused on developing a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the CIFAR-10 dataset, leveraging components like nn.Conv2d, nn.ReLU, nn.Linear, and nn.CrossEntropyLoss. The task emphasized exploring different CNN architectures, optimizers, image preprocessing techniques, and regularization methods. Despite constraints such as not using pre-defined architectures, pretrained weights, or additional packages outside the default Colab environment, I optimized the model's performance through careful design choices. The final deliverables included a Kaggle submission of test predictions, a training curve depicting loss per epoch after training for at least 8 epochs, and an explanation of the model's components and design choices. 

This assignment provided practical insights into machine learning engineering, including reading and implementing documentation, model optimization, and handling real-world constraints.
